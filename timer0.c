A simple example to demonstrate the use of PIC Timers. In this

example the TIMER0 is configured as follows.

*8 Bit Mode
*Clock Source from Prescaler
*Prescaler = FCPU/256 (Note: FCPU= Fosc/4)
*Over flow INT enabled

As our FCPU=20MHz/4 (We are running from 20MHz XTAL)
=5MHz

Time Period = 0.2uS
Prescaller Period = 0.2 x 256 = 51.2uS
Overflow Period   = 51.2 x 256 = 13107.2 uS
                  = 0.0131072 sec

So we need 1/0.0131072 Over Flows to count for 1 sec
= 76.2939 Overflows

So we keep a counter to keep track of overflows.

When an over flow occurs the PIC jumps to ISR where we
increment counter. And when counter becomes 76 we toggle
RB1 pin. This pin is connected to LED. Therefore we
have a LED which is ON for 1 sec and Off for 1sec.

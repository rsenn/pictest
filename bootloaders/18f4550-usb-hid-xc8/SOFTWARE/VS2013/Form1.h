  2.3	08/28/2008	 Initial Release
  2.7a	08/29/2010	 Adding explicit calling conventions to the DllImports.
					 This is needed for Visual Studio 2010 compatibility.

	In order to use these unmanaged functions from within the managed .NET environment, we need
	to explicitly import the functions which we will be using from other .DLL file(s).  Simply
	including the appropriate header files is not enough. 

	Note: In order to avoid potential name conflicts in the header files (which we still use),
	I have renamed the functions by adding "UM" (unmanaged) onto the end of them.  To find 
	documentation for the functions in MSDN, search for the function name without the extra 
	"UM" attached.
	Note2: In the header files (such as setupapi.h), normally the function names are 
	remapped, depending upon if UNICODE is defined or not.  For example, two versions of the
	function SetupDiGetDeviceInterfaceDetail() exist.  One for UNICODE, and one for ANSI.  
	If the wrong version of the function is called, things won't work correctly.  Therefore,
	in order to make sure the correct one gets called (based on your compiler settings, which
	may or may not define "UNICODE"), it is useful to explicity specify the CharSet when doing
	the DLL import.

//OUTPUT:	Returns BOOL.  TRUE when device with matching VID/PID found.  FALSE if device with VID/PID could not be found.

		/* 
		Before we can "connect" our application to our USB embedded device, we must first find the device.
		A USB bus can have many devices simultaneously connected, so somehow we have to find our device only.
		This is done with the Vendor ID (VID) and Product ID (PID).  Each USB product line should have
		a unique combination of VID and PID.  

		Microsoft has created a number of functions which are useful for finding plug and play devices.  Documentation
		for each function used can be found in the MSDN library.  We will be using the following functions:

		SetupDiGetClassDevs()					//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
		SetupDiEnumDeviceInterfaces()			//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
		GetLastError()							//provided by kernel32.dll, which comes with Windows
		SetupDiDestroyDeviceInfoList()			//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
		SetupDiGetDeviceInterfaceDetail()		//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
		SetupDiGetDeviceRegistryProperty()		//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
		malloc()								//part of C runtime library, msvcrt.dll?
		CreateFile()							//provided by kernel32.dll, which comes with Windows

		We will also be using the following unusual data types and structures.  Documentation can also be found in
		the MSDN library:

		PSP_DEVICE_INTERFACE_DATA
		PSP_DEVICE_INTERFACE_DETAIL_DATA
		SP_DEVINFO_DATA
		HDEVINFO
		HANDLE
		GUID

		The ultimate objective of the following code is to get the device path, which will be used elsewhere for getting
		read and write handles to the USB device.  Once the read/write handles are opened, only then can this
		PC application begin reading/writing to the USB device using the WriteFile() and ReadFile() functions.

		Getting the device path is a multi-step round about process, which requires calling several of the
		SetupDixxx() functions provided by setupapi.dll.

		/*This thread does the actual USB read/write operations (but only when AttachedState == TRUE) to the USB device.
		It is generally preferrable to write applications so that read and write operations are handled in a separate
		thread from the main form.  This makes it so that the main form can remain responsive, even if the I/O operations
		take a very long time to complete.

		Since this is a separate thread, this code below executes independently from the rest of the
		code in this application.  All this thread does is read and write to the USB device.  It does not update
		the form directly with the new information it obtains (such as the ANxx/POT Voltage or pushbutton state).
		The information that this thread obtains is stored in atomic global variables.
		Form updates are handled by the FormUpdateTimer Tick event handler function.

		This application sends packets to the endpoint buffer on the USB device by using the "WriteFile()" function.
		This application receives packets from the endpoint buffer on the USB device by using the "ReadFile()" function.
		Both of these functions are documented in the MSDN library.

		All ReadFile() and WriteFile() operations in this example project are synchronous.  They are blocking function
		calls and only return when they are complete, or if they fail because of some event, such as the user unplugging
		the device.  It is possible to call these functions with "overlapped" structures, and use them as non-blocking
		asynchronous I/O function calls.  

		Note:  This code may perform differently on some machines when the USB device is plugged into the host through a
		USB 2.0 hub, as opposed to a direct connection to a root port on the PC.  In some cases the data rate may be slower
		when the device is connected through a USB 2.0 hub.  This performance difference is believed to be caused by
		the issue described in Microsoft knowledge base article 940021:
		http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940021/en-us 

		Higher effective bandwidth (up to the maximum offered by interrupt endpoints), both when connected
		directly and through a USB 2.0 hub, can generally be achieved by queuing up multiple pending read and/or
		write requests simultaneously.  This can be done when using	asynchronous I/O operations (calling ReadFile() and
		WriteFile()	with overlapped structures).  The Microchip	HID USB Bootloader application uses asynchronous I/O
		for some USB operations and the source code can be used	as an example.*/

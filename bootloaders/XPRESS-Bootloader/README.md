XPRESS-BootLoader
=============

USB-MSD Bootloader
------------------

This application is designed to act as a boot loader for the MPLAB
Xpress Evaluation Board's 18F25K50. Specifically it was meant to be 
used for the Hackaday Belgrade Badge.

Usage
-----
-   Power off the board and press Button S1 (RB0 to digital low), Xpress Board has this labeled as "Reset"

-   Apply power to the board, and then release the button (RB0 to Digital High)

-   A new mass storage device named HackABadge should appear

-   Copy a hex file (appropriately addressed) to this device

-   Press the button S1 again to exit the bootloader

-   Upon exiting the bootloader, or on a restart, code execution will begin at **0x3000**

Specifics/Limitations
---------
-   The bootloader currently reserves 0x0000-0x2FFF of the Program Flash. Application code **must** stay above this. Any code in HEX file below this value will **not** be written.
    
-   Application interrupt vectors are moved to 0x3008 and 0x3018

-   Only will modify program flash memory. DataEE and Configuration word changes are **not** currently supported

Product Support
---------------

-   This application runs on the PIC18LF25K50.

-   The input (file) parsing algorithm is compatible with all PIC18 INTEL
    Hex files produced by the MPLAB XC8 compiler.


Folder Structure
----------------

-   *MPLAB.X* - contains the main application source files

-   *framework* - elements of the MLA - USB and File System open source
    libraries (note: the MSD portion has been customised to reduce considerably
    RAM usage)

-   *utilities* - contains the Windows signed drivers for the Virtual COM port
    (OS X and Linux users do not need it)

-   *bsp* - board support package (currently only the XPRESS evaluation board)

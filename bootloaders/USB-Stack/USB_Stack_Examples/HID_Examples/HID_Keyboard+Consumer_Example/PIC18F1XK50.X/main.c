/*
 * USB uC BOOTLOADER INSTRUCTIONS
 * 
 * 1. SETUP PROJECT
 * Right click on your MPLABX project, and select Properties. 
 * Under XC8 global options, click XC8 linker. In the Option categories dropdown, 
 * select Additional options. In the Codeoffset input, you need to put an 
 * offset of 0x2000. (For PIC16F145X offset is in words, therefore 0x1000)
 * 
 * If you are using the a J Series bootloader:
 * In the Option categories dropdown, select Memory Model. In the ROM ranges 
 * input, you need to put a range starting from the Codeoffset (0x2000) to 1KB from last 
 * byte in flash. e.g. For X7J53, 2000-1FBFF is used. This makes sure your code 
 * isn't placed in the same Flash Page as the Config Words. That area is write 
 * protected.
 * 
 * PIC18FX6J53: 2000-FBFF.
 * PIC18FX7J53: 2000-1FBFF.
 * 
 * 2. DOWNLOAD FROM MPLABX
 * You can get MPLABX to download your code every time you press build. 
 * To set this up, right click on your MPLABX project, and select Properties. 
 * Under Conf: [Default], click Building. Check the Execute this line after 
 * build box and place in this line of code (use the drive letter or name of 
 * your device depending on OS):
 * 
 * Windows Example: cp ${ImagePath} E:\ 
 *                  **Needs a space following "\".
 * 
 * OSX Example: cp ${ImagePath} /Volumes/PIC18FX7J53
 * 
 * Linux Example: cp ${ImagePath} /media/PIC18FX7J53
 * 
 * 3. START BOOTLOADER
 * If you have previously loaded a program, reset your device or insert the USB 
 * cable whilst holding down the bootloader button. The bootloader LED will 
 * blink 3 times fast to indicate "bootloader mode" is active. If no program is 
 * present, just insert the USB cable. Your PIC will now appear in My Computer 
 * as a thumb drive.
 * 
 * 4. READ/ERASE
 * If you've previously loaded a program, PROG_MEM.BIN file will exist on the 
 * drive. You can use this file to view the raw binary of your program using a 
 * hex editor. If you wish to erase your program, just delete this file. After 
 * the erase completes, the bootloader will restart and you can load a new program.
 * 
 * 5. EEPROM READ/WRITE/ERASE
 * For PICs that have EEPROM, a EEPROM.BIN file will also exist on the drive. 
 * This file can be used to view your EEPROM and modify it's values. Open the 
 * file in a hex editor, and modify any values and save the file. You can also 
 * erase all the EEPROM values by deleting this file (the bootloader will restart, 
 * and the file will reappear with blank EEPROM).
 * 
 * 6. DOWNLOAD
 * To program, simply drag and drop your hex file or right click your hex file 
 * and select send to PIC18FXXXXX. The bootloader will close and instantly start 
 * running your code. Alternatively, as seen in step two, you can get MPLABX to 
 * download the file automatically after a build.
